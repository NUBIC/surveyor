# Survey On Rails

Surveyor is a rails (gem) plugin, that brings surveys to your rails app. Before Rails 2.3, it was implemented as a Rails Engine. Surveys are written in a DSL (Domain Specific Language), with examples available in the "kitchen sink" survey.

## Why you might want to use Surveyor

If you have to have a part of your Rails app that asks users questions as part of a survey, quiz, or questionnaire then you should consider using Surveyor. This plugin was designed out of the need to deliver clinical research surveys to large populations of people but it can be used for any type of survey. It has an easy to use DSL to define the questions, response dependencies (if user answers 'A' to question 1 then show question 1a, etc...), and structure (different sections of longer questionnaires).

To build your questionnaire you define it using a custom DSL. Having a DSL instead of a GUI makes it significantly easier to import long surveys (no more endless clicking and typing into tiny text boxes). It also means that you can let your customer write out the survey, edit, re-edit, tweak, throw out and start over, any number of surveys without having to change a single line of code in your app. 

## DSL example

Our DSL supports a wide range of question types (too many to list here) and varying dependency logic. Here are the first few questions of the "kitchen_sink" survey which should give you and idea of how the DSL works. The full example with all the types of questions is in the plugin and available if you run the installation instructions below.

    survey "&#8220;Kitchen Sink&#8221; survey" do
    
      section "Basic questions" do
        # A label is a question that accepts no answers
        label "These questions are examples of the basic supported input types"
    
        # A basic question with radio buttons
        question_1 "What is your favorite color?", :pick => :one
        answer "red"
        answer "blue"
        answer "green"
        answer "yellow"
        answer :other
    
        # A basic question with checkboxes
        # "question" and "answer" may be abbreviated as "q" and "a"
        q_2 "Choose the colors you don't like", :pick => :any
        a_1 "red"
        a_2 "blue"
        a_3 "green"
        a_4 "yellow"
        a :omit
    
        # A dependent question, with conditions and rule to logically join them  
        # the question's reference identifier is "2a", and the answer's reference_identifier is "1"
        # question reference identifiers used in conditions need to be unique on a survey for the lookups to work
        q_2a "Please explain why you don't like this color?"
        a_1 "explanation", :text
        dependency :rule => "A or B or C or D"
        condition_A :q_2, "==", :a_1
        condition_B :q_2, "==", :a_2
        condition_C :q_2, "==", :a_3
        condition_D :q_2, "==", :a_4
    
        # ... other question, sections and such. See kitchen_sink_survey.rb for more.
     end 
    
    end
   
The survey above shows a couple simple question types. The first one is a "pick one" type with the "other" custom entry. The second question is a "pick any" type with the option to "omit". It also has a dependency where you can ask a follow up question based on how the user answered the previous question. Notice the way the dependency is defined as a string. This implementation supports any number of complex dependency rules so not just "A or B or C or D" but "A and (B or C) and D" or "!A or ((B and !C) or D)". The conditions are the letters used they are evaluated separately using the operators defined for "==","<>", ">=","<", (the usual stuff) the plugged in to the dependency rule and evaluated. See the example survey for more details.

# Installation

As a plugin:

    gem install haml
    script/plugin install git://github.com/breakpointer/surveyor.git -r 'tag v0.10.0'

Or as a gem plugin:
  
    # in environment.rb
    config.gem "surveyor", :version => '~> 0.10.0', :source => 'http://gemcutter.org'
  
    rake gems:install

Generate assets, run migrations:
    
    script/generate surveyor
    rake db:migrate

Try out the "kitchen sink" survey:

    rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb

The rake surveyor task overwrites previous surveys by default, but can append instead:

    rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb APPEND=true

The rake tasks above generate surveys in our custom survey DSL (which is a great format for end users and stakeholders to use). 
After you have run them start up your app:
    
    script/server

(or however you normally start your app) and goto:

    http://localhost:3000/surveys

Try taking the survey and compare it to the contents of the DSL file kitchen\_sink\_survey.rb. See how each type of
DSL question maps to the resulting rendered view of the question.

# Configuration

The surveyor generator creates config/initializers/surveyor.rb. There, you can specify:

- your own relative root for surveys ('/' is not recommended as any path will be interpreted as a survey name)
- your own custom title (string) for the survey list page
- your own custom layout file name, in your app/views/layouts folder
- your own custom finish url for all surveys. you can give a string (a path), a symbol (the name of a method in ApplicationController)
- if you would like surveys to require authorization via the restful_authentication plugin
- if you would like to extend the surveyor_controller (see Extending Surveyor below)

The initializer runs once, when the app starts. The block style is used to keep multiple options DRY (defaults below):

    Surveyor::Config.run do |config|
      config['default.relative_url_root'] = nil # "surveys"
      config['default.title'] = nil # "You can take these surveys:"
      config['default.layout'] = nil # "surveyor_default"
      config['default.index'] =  nil # "/surveys" # or :index_path_method
      config['default.finish'] =  nil # "/surveys" # or :finish_path_method
      #config['authentication_method'] = :login_required # set to true to use restful authentication
      config['extend'] = %w() # %w(survey surveyor_helper surveyor_controller)
    end

You can update surveyor's configuration at any time. Use the block style (above), or the individual style:

    Surveyor::Config['default.title'] = "Cheese is great!"

To look at the current surveyor configuration:
    
    Surveyor::Config.to_hash.inspect

# Extending surveyor

Surveyor's models, helper, and controller can be extended from custom modules your app/models, app/helpers and app/controllers directories. To generate the sample files and sample layout, run:

    script/generate extend_surveyor

Any of surveyor's models class_eval, class methods, and instance methods can be modified. Include the following in config/initializers/surveyor.rb:

    require 'models/survey_extensions' # Extended the survey model

SurveyorHelper class_eval and instance methods can be modified. Include the following in config/initializers/surveyor.rb:

    require 'helpers/surveyor_helper_extensions' # Extend the surveyor helper

SurveyorController class_eval, class methods, instance methods, and actions can be modified. Action methods should be specified separately in the Actions submodule. Set the following option in config/initializers/surveyor.rb Surveyor::Config block:

    config['extend_controller'] = true

# Sample layout

The <code>surveyor\_includes</code> helper just calls <code>surveyor\_stylsheets + surveyor\_javascripts</code> which in turn call:

    stylesheet_link_tag 'surveyor/reset', 'surveyor/surveyor', 'surveyor/ui.theme.css','surveyor/jquery-ui-slider-additions'

    javascript_include_tag 'surveyor/jquery-1.2.6.js', 'surveyor/jquery-ui-personalized-1.5.3.js', 'surveyor/accessibleUISlider.jQuery.js','surveyor/jquery.form.js', 'surveyor/surveyor.js'
    
# Dependencices

Surveyor depends on Rails 3 and HAML (http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/download).
